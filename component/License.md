Article 2 The Service 

2.1 The Service consists of the Supplier supplying and continuing to supply the Plot Platform to the Client. The Client can reach the Users via the Plot Platform by sending a Client dispatched, Plot Dashboard setup Location Based Notification when a User enters or is in a Geofence within a Client defined time interval. The Plot Plugin will be made available to the Client for the communication between the Plot Backend and the App, which should be integrated in the App. 

2.2 The Client should create an Account to use this Service. The Client is personally responsible for the confidentiality of the Login details for his/her Account. As soon as the Client knows or suspects that his/her Login details have come into the hands of unauthorized persons he/she must notify the Supplier immediately, without prejudice to his/her own commitments to take immediate effective measures, such as changing the Login details. Therefore the client accepts and agrees that the Client is always responsible and liable for the use of the Service by external parties via the Clients Account. The Client indemnifies the Supplier of all damages and costs arriving from and/or related to the use of the Services, via the Clients Account, by external parties.

In the event of an emergency requiring the Service to be ceased or limited immediately, the Supplier will inform the Client as quickly as reasonably possible.
