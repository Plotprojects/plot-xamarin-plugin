Plot Xamarin Plugin
===================
Add location based notifications to your Xamarin project easily.

### Supported platforms ###

This plugins supports both IOS 6 or newer, and Android 2.3 or newer.

Tested under Xamarin Studio 5.10. Because this library uses native bindings the Xamarin Starter Edition is *NOT* supported.

### Integration and configuration ###

You can find the integration guide at our website: [http://www.plotprojects.com/xamarin-integration/](http://www.plotprojects.com/xamarin-integration/)

Additional settings are possible using the configuration file, an example is shown below. The publicToken and enableOnFirstRun fields are required, the notificationSmallIcon, notificationAccentColor and askPermissionAgainAfterDays options are Android only, the maxRegionsMonitored is an iOS only setting.

Information about these settings can be found in our extensive documentation, in chapter 1.4: [http://www.plotprojects.com/documentation#ConfigurationFile](http://www.plotprojects.com/documentation#ConfigurationFile)
